./flow3 addalot:setup:createcards4 100 20 1

The 1st command:
Creates and adds 100 cards to the CardRepository without creating a part for them and thus also without adding them to any part

The 2nd command:
100 cards are created as well but each 20 cards are added to a new part which itself is then added to the PartRepository





Command syntax:
./flow3 addalot:setup:createcards4 amount_total group_each add_to_parts
